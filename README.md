# movie-app

This is an app that allows a user to search for a movie to watch based on their particular mood or preferences. 

There are a series of 4 questions, each with 2 to 8 possible choices. There are a total of 196 possible combinations. 

The user chooses: genre, time period, subgenre, and whether critics' reviews are important to them.

This app was created using html, css and javascript. I used Materialize to create several components.

I plan to improve this app by adding more results, making all the links functional, adding new sections and generally improving the interface. Eventually, I would like to be able to connect this to a database.
