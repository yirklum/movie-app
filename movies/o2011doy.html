                        <p>O.J.: Made In America is a documentary released by ESPN Films as a five-part miniseries and in theatrical format. 
                           Through interviews, news footage, and archival audio and video, it traces the life and career of O. J. Simpson, 
                           starting with his arrival at the University of Southern California as an emerging football superstar and ending 
                           with his incarceration in 2007 for robbery. Throughout the documentary, Simpson's life – the football success, 
                           television career, relationship with Nicole Brown, the domestic abuse, Nicole and Ron Goldman's murder, the trial – 
                           runs parallel to the larger narrative of the city of Los Angeles, which serves as host to mounting racial tensions, 
                           and a volatile relationship between the city's police department and the African American community. Footage from the 
                           Watts Riots was used as well as the entire Rodney King video, which most news outlets and documentaries only use in parts. 
                           Both these events are used to set up and explain what happened during the Simpson murder trial.
